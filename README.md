# Flower Prediction and Gardening Assistant

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a flower prediction and gardening assistant utilizing machine learning models and a dataset of over 4000 flower images across five different species. The tool assists users in identifying flowers and provides detailed care instructions.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-prediction-project.git
cd flower-prediction-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The project uses two main datasets:
1. **Flower Dataset**: A collection of 4000+ images of flowers across five categories stored in `image_data/`. This includes a `labels` text file for classification.
2. **About.csv**: Contains gardening details about each flower type, including care instructions and environmental needs.

Data is stored and managed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), ensuring data integrity and availability.

## Usage

To run the flower prediction model:

```bash
python predict.py --image_path '<path_to_image>'
```

To access gardening tips, navigate to:

```bash
python gardening_tips.py --flower_name '<flower_name>'
```
